### Flatten an object

        'depth' => [
            'level' => 1,
            'level2' => [
                'level3' => 3,
            ],
        ],
    ],
];

$skeleton = new InPunktoNET\ObjectFlatten();
echo $skeleton->toFlattenString(data: $object, separator: '.', delimiter: ';');
```

Response:
```php
company.name;InPunktoNET
company.depth.level;1

    "company.depth.level;1",
    "company.depth.level2.level3;3"
];
```

```php
$skeleton = new InPunktoNET\ObjectFlatten();
echo $skeleton->toObject(data: $object, separator: '.', delimiter: ';');
